We kicked the night off with some standup sets by BK Chris, followed by Robbie

Much light was made of the fact that I was run over by a car in Nashville the

Next, we did a live Run Your Mouth podcast, where I presented a one-time-only
[slide deck](/billgates.html) about Bill Gates and why he is evil in far more

Check the livestream recording above for a look into how the evening went!
