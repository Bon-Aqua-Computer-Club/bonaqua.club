## Background
> Bon Aqua Computer Club is owned & operated by [Andrew
> Grathwohl](https://grathwohl.me).

My goal with the Bon Aqua Computer Club is to build an abundant local community
centered around the ideas of free software, self-reliant computing, and other
endeavors that empower individuals to escape the wrath of Big Tech, the cloud,
and the surveillance state.

I moved to Bon Aqua from New York, NY, where I spent most of my childhood and
adult years until the COVID-19 lockdowns began taking place. It became clear to
me that this was not a disaster that we were going to protest like we did the
Iraq War, like the Stonewall Riots, and like the Union Square direct action in
the early 20th century.

After many years of believing in the things that make Tennessee great - a
respect for others' natural rights, an inherently limited centralized state
authority that works in service of peopleâ€™s liberties, etc., - I finally
decided to seek it out, and I am so happy I did.
