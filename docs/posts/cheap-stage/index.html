<h2 id="use-merchandising-display-stands">Use Merchandising Display Stands</h2>
<p>Retail stores are not exactly getting the same foot traffic to which they were
once accustomed. For this reason, the suppliers of products purchased by
retailers and merchandisers are going way down in price.</p>
<p>One of the most common merchandiser utilities is the display stand, like the one
pictured above. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forte-Products-8002128-Display-Black/dp/B00962U0WG?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1">On Amazon</a>, one manufacturer of such things offers a particularly
good deal (<strong>$86.95</strong> at time of posting) for their 2x4 ft stands, which easily
hold up to 2,000lbs of weight each.</p>
<p>I went ahead and purchased four of these - which Amazon shipped via prime! - and
put them together to construct a stage for a concert I held last summer. Holding
a total of 8,000lbs, spread across 128 sq ft of elevated stage, I cannot think
of any other way to get this done for under $400!</p>

<p>For a look at how the stages performed for our event, give Robbie TheFire
Bernstein&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQn4xc4gGsQ">live stream video of the night</a> a view!</p>
