      Cheap DIY Performance Stage

  </h2>
  
    Music should be for all! If you agree, and have the space available to host your own performances during this unprecedented global assault upon the working class, chances are you&rsquo;ll need a stage to elevate your booked acts above the audience. This is the most cost-effective DIY stage I know of.
 Use Merchandising Display Stands Retail stores are not exactly getting the same foot traffic to which they were once accustomed.

      Run Your Mouth: Summer Porch Tour 2021
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    The first live event at the Bon Aqua Computer Club was a resounding success, and put us on an amazing trajectory for future endeavors.
 We kicked the night off with some standup sets by BK Chris, followed by Robbie TheFire Bernstein.
Much light was made of the fact that I was run over by a car in Nashville the previous day.
Next, we did a live Run Your Mouth podcast, where I presented a one-time-only slide deck about Bill Gates and why he is evil in far more ways than one.
