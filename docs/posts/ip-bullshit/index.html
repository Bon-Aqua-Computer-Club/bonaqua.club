<h2 id="analyzing-keha---take-it-off">Analyzing Ke$ha - &ldquo;Take It Off&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Ke$ha&rsquo;s music can be described as many things, but complex, deep, and romantic
are not terms that come to my mind right away. And yet, her music videos are
captured by the same sorts of professional studios and crews that (used to be)
called upon by Hollywood to produce their shlocky content.</p>
<p>I happen to know where to acquire master video assets for many of the pop music
world&rsquo;s hits, going back 20 years. Today&rsquo;s digital citizen risks being labeled a
criminal for having such materials. And yet, YouTube is never deemed criminal
for how cheaply they treat other peoples' intellectual property.</p>
<p>So, why should we allow them to police us when they do such a horrid job doing
what they&rsquo;re legitimately supposed to be doing? Should we not expect better than
this if we are going to be probed, tracked, and manipulated by Alphabet&rsquo;s
YouTube video service?</p>

<p>I captured the above image from my own <strong>HIGHLY ILLEGAL COPY</strong> of the music
video for the Ke$ha track, <em>&ldquo;Take It Off&rdquo;</em>. Comparing it with the below, a
screen grab of the exact same frame but from YouTube&rsquo;s &ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; video
stream, should illustrate precisely why media streaming is complete bullshit.</p>
