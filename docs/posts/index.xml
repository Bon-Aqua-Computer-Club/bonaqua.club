      <description>Music should be for all!

      <description>The first live event at the Bon Aqua Computer Club was a resounding success, and put us on an amazing trajectory for future endeavors.
We kicked the night off with some standup sets by BK Chris, followed by Robbie TheFire Bernstein.
Much light was made of the fact that I was run over by a car in Nashville the previous day.
Next, we did a live Run Your Mouth podcast, where I presented a one-time-only slide deck about Bill Gates and why he is evil in far more ways than one.</description>
