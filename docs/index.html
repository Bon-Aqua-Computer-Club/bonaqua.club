    Would someone like to calmly explain to me why we should respect the wishes of Big Music when they clearly have no interest in respecting musicians and their fans?
 Analyzing Ke$ha - &ldquo;Take It Off&rdquo; Ke$ha&rsquo;s music can be described as many things, but complex, deep, and romantic are not terms that come to my mind right away. And yet, her music videos are captured by the same sorts of professional studios and crews that (used to be) called upon by Hollywood to produce their shlocky content.

      Run Your Mouth: Summer Porch Tour 2021

    The first live event at the Bon Aqua Computer Club was a resounding success, and put us on an amazing trajectory for future endeavors.
 We kicked the night off with some standup sets by BK Chris, followed by Robbie TheFire Bernstein.
Much light was made of the fact that I was run over by a car in Nashville the previous day.
Next, we did a live Run Your Mouth podcast, where I presented a one-time-only slide deck about Bill Gates and why he is evil in far more ways than one.
